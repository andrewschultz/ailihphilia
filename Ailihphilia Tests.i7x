part9 = the kayo yak chase

chapter mistake quizzing

[each one is 10 mistakes. I may cut this down or add to it based on what people find. m0 eliminates the everywhere LLPs, which are less likely to have bugs.]

[finord and trying a LLP is worth checking as well.]

test m0 with "refer/peep/poop/stats/dial aid".
