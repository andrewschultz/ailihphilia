chapter warpchecking

understand "wc [number]" as warpchecking.

carry out warpchecking:
	let our-result be false;
	let program-result be false;
	let this-row be 0;
	let oops be 0;
	if the number understood < 1 or the number understood > 3, say "1=GUY UG 2=SMH MS 3=TOOLS LOOT." instead;
	repeat through table of goodacts:
		increment this-row;
		now our-result is false;
		if there is a use1 entry and there is a use2 entry:
			if this-row is 16:
				now our-result is sap-takeable; [this is a bad hack for saw/sap]
			else if use1 entry is moot or use2 entry is moot:
				now our-result is true;
		else if there is a preproc entry:
			consider the preproc entry;
			if the rule failed:
				now our-result is true;
			else:
				now our-result is false;
		if number understood is 1, now program-result is guy-need entry;
		if number understood is 2, now program-result is ms-need entry;
		if number understood is 3, now program-result is tool-need entry;
		if program-result is not our-result:
			say "[b]WE DID [if program-result is false]EXTRA[else]TOO LITTLE[end if][r] at row [this-row]: [warp-description of number understood] requirement=[program-result] and we-did=[our-result]: [if there is a use1 entry][use1 entry]+[use2 entry][else][preproc entry][end if][if there is a getit entry]=[getit entry][end if]: [program-result] vs [our-result].";
			increment oops;
	say "Results for [warp-description of number understood]: ";
	say "[if oops is 0]Everything is OK![else]# of discrepancies = [oops].[end if]";
	the rule succeeds.
