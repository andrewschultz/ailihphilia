>Introduction
?What's this game about?
Palindromes.
It's a bit restrictive, since they're a bit rare.
But I hope you find my riffs on them interesting.
?Fake clues! Some people mentioned don't exist!
The game picks a few people's names randomly on startup. There is one male and one female.
None of this has any effect on the story. But I figured it was a decent way to combine (relative) gender balance with being able to show off a few of the cooler names I found.
>Dim Mid
>>FUN 'NUF
?Why can't I leave?
You need to take the pact cap the right way, to show you're serious about things.
TAKE CAP doesn't work.
What's a theme of the game?
Palindromes.
?How do I take the cap?
The command ?????? CAP needs to be a palindrome.
How do you put a cap in inventory? Tuck it away?
PACK CAP.
?Why doesn't the cap seem perfectly satisfactory?
You can do one other thing with the cap, to make yourself go faster.
It must be some command like PAC? CAP.
PACE CAP.
Also, PACY CAP is accepted, too.
?Which way do I go first?
Well, one way, there's only one room you can explore.
Also, there are no permadeaths.
There's no penalty for guessing wrong.
You'll want to start by going east.
?Hey! Look! There's a way back south!
The Tix Exit appears pretty soon, but it doesn't let you through.
Unsurprisingly, you need tix of your own.
You don't get them until the end.
Once you defeat the Diktat Kid, you get X-ITE TIX. Wow!
Which claim to lead you to a bigger adventure.
Use the tix on the exit.
Or, well, you can just go south.
And you win the game!
?How do I build the North-Tron?
It'll take a long time.
Once you have all the ingredients, you'll know.
USE TNT ON ORE ZERO.
Well, it can be any ingredient on any ingredient.
?I built the North-Tron. Why can't I go north?
You need a weapon.
There is a Yard Ray located elsewhere.
Also, you'll need to load the Yard Ray.
With something suitably weird and energetic.
USE MURDERED RUM ON YARD RAY.
?My weapon has juice. Why can't I go north?
You need to know how to operate it.
You need one final palindrome command.
The ray says EMIT ********.
What could those eight letters mean?
You can guess the last four.
And there are omly so many possibilities for the middle.
EMIT NOONTIME.
?I don't have confidence I can use the yard ray right! What can I do?
Is there any item that can be destroyed, but it'd put up useful resistance?
The test set in Work Row.
?Now I defeated the Diktat Kid, how do I get out?
This one should be pretty simple.
You got a new item in the Dirge Grid.
It's similar to the Tix Exit.
USE X-ITE TIX ON TIX EXIT.
You win!
>>DIRGE GRID
?Help! Two henchmen are in the way!
If you don't have the items to kill them, don't worry. The game kicks you to back where you were.
You need one item to dispose of each of them.
?Do I have to pick off one henchman first?
No. Either way is okay.
?What is the Knife Fink's weakness?
The Knife Fink is a mercenary.
Do you have anything shiny or valuable?
There's no currency, but there is a jewel.
USE ME GEM ON KNIFE FINK
?What is the Verses Rev's weakness?
The Verses Rev sure is holier than thou!
Maybe you can offend the Verses Rev.
USE TABOO BAT ON VERSES REV.
?How do I defeat the Diktat Kid?
USE YARD RAY ON REDIVIDER.
Now you will get a new item, and you can go back south and win the game.
>Grebeberg
>>SEER TREES
?How do I get rid of the Stark Rats?
You need a Trap.
Well, you may guess a specific sort of trap.
A Party Trap.
You can make it in Work Row, in Yelpley.
You have to do something to another item. But once you get it...
USE PARTY TRAP ON STARK RATS.
>>COLD LOC
?What do I do with the rift fir and past sap?
The past sap seems glued to the rift fir. Maybe you could wedge it off.
Any blade you have that might work?
USE WASH SAW ON PAST SAP.
Now you need a container.
USE PUCE CUP ON PAST SAP.
?What do I do with King Nik?
He needs a book.
So you need to have Word Row open.
Which is most about history and stuff?
Epoch Cope.
USE EPOCH COPE ON KING NIK.
The Spur Ups are handy back in Yelpley, to motivate you.
>>APSE SPA
?Can I peel off the dose sod?
Yes, but you'll need a container.
The Puce Cup in Ned's Den works well.
USE PUCE CUP ON DOSE SOD.
?Is there anything beyond the Apse Spa, in Go-By Bog?
Yes, but it'd be tricky without a map or something.
You need to get the spa maps.
Not only do you need them, you need someone who can make sense out of them.
Once you get them, you will find something cool if you
USE SPA MAPS ON GO-BY BOG.
Or you can just examine the maps in Apse Spa.
>>FLU GULF
?How to I help out the Gulf Lug?
He needs something to cure him.
If you haven't figured the Emo Dome yet, you won't have seen it.
The Swept Pews have what you need.
The Demo Med.
USE DEMO MED ON GULF LUG.
?Why can't I go west?
You need a protection against the Yuge Guy's orange-ish radiation.
Did you get the Nat's Tan in Bon Snob?
It's icky to even handle, without using.
You need to feel mentally prepared to take it.
STAND NAT'S.
Then once you get it, it can cause the rocs to look bad.
USE NAT'S TAN ON SCORN ROCS.
>>OOZE ZOO
?How do I get rid of the sleep eels?
They are blocking you but don't seem comfortable.
Maybe you can find a nicer place for them to sleep.
Or something nicer to sleep on.
The bunk nub doesn't quite work.
But you can turn it into something nicer.
You can upgrade the bunk nub by using it on the reviver in Work Row.
USE STOCK COTS ON SLEEP EELS.
>>FRUSH SURF
?What do I do with the yak?
It's a bit complicated.
USE TROLL ORT ON BRAG GARB.
Now the yak runs after you.
You need to run N.N.W.W.S.S. to the Ergot Ogre.
The yak knocks the ogre over with a special command, allowing you passage east from the Lair Trial.
This command starts with yak...
YAK OKAY.
>>MOO ROOM
?What do I do here?
Get the Poo Coop.
You can deal with the hay much later.
?What can I do with the yahoo hay?
Two things. First, you can make it into something artier.
But you need help.
Once you've read all the books in Word Row, a new one pops out.
USE SOME DEMOS ON YAHOO HAY.
Later you can make it into something more practical.
USE ENACT CANE ON YAHOO HAY.
>>SNEER GREENS
?How do I kill off the Yuge Guy?
You'll need something to dent his pride.
Something you yourself may have had trouble taking, because you were too proud at first.
USE REP POPPER ON ME TOTEM.
>>DUMB MUD
?How do I get rid of the gnu dung blocking the way west?
You need something that can hold dung, or something like it.
The poo coop.
USE POO COOP ON GNU DUNG.
?How do I get rid of the turf rut blocking the way south?
Well, you need to fill it in somehow.
Maybe you've just gotten something that you can use to fill it in.
See the clue above!
The poo coop is full.
USE POO COOP ON TURF RUT.
?Can I dispose of the Lie Veil?
Yes, but not til much later.
You need something true, or something that shows you've been true.
If you get rid of all the books, you'll get a neat item.
USE EXAM AXE ON LIE VEIL.
>>MONT NOM
?What is Rob doing? How do I get rid of him?
BORE ROB.
?Can I make any sort of special food here?
Yes, and there are several possibilities.
There are four foods you can't eat. Two are solid, two are liquid.
It doesn't matter which solid you use with which liquid.
USE GIFT FIG ON MAYO YAM.
USE SNACK CANS ON UFO TOFU.
>>LE BABEL
?What is the opossum doing? Is it useful?
Only for maximum points.
An affectionate gesture would go a long way.
The opossum isn't a palindrome, but maybe the middle part...
MUSS OPOSSUM.
?Why can't I take the bro orb?
You're not at peace with yourself.
You need to have spent time in the Tao Boat for that to happen.
>>SWAMP MAWS
?What is the made dam for?
It looks pretty hashed together, bumpy. Something could be in there.
USE RADAR ON MADE DAM.
This helps you locate something.
>>ALL-IVY VILLA
?Why won't the Code Doc help me?
Help the Code Doc make a full house.
The all-ivy villa is not covered on top. If something went over it, it'd be complete.
Maybe you have found a covering elsewhere?
Like, in the Trapeze Part?
USE TENT NET ON CODE DOC.
?What does the Code Doc have to say?
The code doc could help you decipher something.
Do you have a document that almost, but doesn't quite, make sense?
The spa maps, once you get them.
USE SPA MAPS ON CODE DOC.
?What's the deal with the name change?
Well, it's not *all* ivy now that the tent net is on top, so it had to be changed.
There is no practical difference. I hope you enjoy the name change.
?A porch crop sprouted up! How do I tame or trim it?
Do you have any sharp item that worked before to cut something?
The wash saw worked on the past sap.
USE WASH SAW ON PORCH CROP.
>>LAIR TRIAL
?What to do here?
Not much.
>>MOTTO BOTTOM
?What can I do with the tame mat?
Its current motto is a bit lame. It could be more thoughtful.
Any item you have that says smarts?
The sage gas.
USE SAGE GAS ON TAME MAT.
?What is the guru rug for?
It hides an even greater secret.
It's too esoteric, but maybe you could inject some emotion into it.
Anything t hat might get you enthusiastic?
USE SHARP RAHS ON GURU RUG.
>>YACK CAY
?How do I get past the Known Wonk?
The Known Wonk seems to know a lot, but that doesn't contribute to happiness.
Maybe a book could help.
USE NULL ILLUN ON KNOWN WONK.
What is the Edits Tide good for?
USE EL DOODLE ON EDITS TIDE.
?Can I clean the Tru Yurt?
The Dirt Rid doesn't quite do the trick. Not energetic enough.
USE MOOR BROOM ON TRU YURT.
>>CALCIFIC LAC
?What do I do with the Tao Boat?
It won't let you in unless you have something that shows self-effacement.
You'll know the item when you see it.
The Dork Rod.
USE DORK ROD ON TAO BOAT.
Now that you're all peaceful, you can explore other places.
?The Tao Boat caused one of my items to be diminished! What else do I need to do?
The dork rod no longer seems as cool as it used to.
You need to make it more subversive.
The not-a-baton can be used on the reifier in Work Row.
?Can the kayak take me anywhere?
Yes, but you need something to propel you.
An oar, or a pole, or something.
The elope pole you got from the net in the Trapeze Part should work.
USE ELOPE POLE ON KAYAK.
?Cool! I got something with the kayak trip. What do I do with it?
It rattles a bit. Something's inside.
How would you open the buoy if you can't do so manually?
Use a machine.
Using the you buoy on the rotator in Work Row will cause something to fall out.
>Yelpley
>>YAWN WAY
?Is there anything to do here?
No, not much, other than go a bunch of different directions.
?How do I go east?
You need the Spur Ups from the Cold Loc.
But having them isn't enough.
You need them to do something up.
PUFF UP.
>>ART XTRA
?What do I need to do to get the Trap Art?
Nothing. Just take it. It's useful elsewhere.
?What do I need to do to get El Doodle?
Nothing. Just take it. It's useful elsewhere.
?What are the stray arts for?
General scenery and stuff.
?How do I give the Revolt Lover something cool?
You need to find something elsewhere, late in the game.
The book SOME DEMOS gives advice on making art...
...and the Yahoo Hay in the Moo Room gives some art and building materials.
USE STRAW ARTS ON REVOLT LOVER.
>>EVADED AVE
?Why won't the door frood let me go west or east?
The door frood is a bit of a jerk.
Maybe if you gave them a gift, they'd be happy.
A book that has "froody" humor? That gives them someone to look down on?
USE TO IDIOT ON DOOR FROOD.
>>YELL ALLEY
?What is the navy van for?
It has a small eye you can scan something on.
What sheets of paper could go in the navy van/on the eye?
Most you find are just for you.
But one has a free something or other. Just, you can't redeem it by yourself.
USE PITY TIP ON EYE.
?How do I get the TNT from the bomb mob?
You need an agent to do it for you.
Do you have the DNA band or DNA hand?
With the band, put it in the right machine.
You need to mobilize the hand to get the TNT. It's small enough, the mob won't spot it.
USE ROTO MOTOR ON DNA HAND.
USE MR ARM ON BOMB MOB.
Or the TNT.
>>TRAPEZE PART
?How do I get across the trapeze?
The net isn't quite stable yet.
There's a way to make it a bit more stable.
TEND NET.
>>MY GYM
?How do I get around Dave?
Well, you need to avoid him. Not quite avoid him.
But do something to him. ????? DAVE.
EVADE DAVE.
?What is the wash saw for?
It could be useful to cut something small and stubborn.
Wood, maybe. Or something from wood.
What you need to cut is over in Grebeberg.
>>WORN ROW
?How do I get past Ian?
NAIL IAN.
?It's empty here. How do I fill things out a bit?
They're worN. But maybe worn row can become...
WORK ROW.
You can also change it to something else.
WORD ROW.
?What do I put in which machine? Can I mess things up?
You can use trial and error.
Or you can just use the spoilers below.
There's no way to use the machines to break the game.
?Why does the cart seem a bit oddly shaped?
Well, this is not critical to the game.
You can do something with the Tract cart.
Look for a hidden latch, or something.
TRACE CART.
The book that drops out is not useful.
?What do I do with the reifier?
There are three things.
You may notice the trap art is a plan for something bigger, to be made real.
The first item is the trap art.
USE TRAP ART ON REIFIER.
The second is the DNA band.
USE DNA BAND ON REIFIER.
The third is the not-a-baton.
USE NOT-A-BATON ON REIFIER.
?What do I do with the rotator?
The first item is the stinky knits.
USE STINKY KNITS ON ROTATOR.

USE GOLD LOG ON ROTATOR.
The third item is the you buoy.
USE YOU BUOY ON ROTATOR.

The first item is the bunk nub.
USE BUNK NUB ON REVIVER.
The second item is the eroded ore.
USE ERODED ORE ON REVIVER.
The third item is the dirt rid.
USE DIRT RID ON REVIVER.
?Help! A machine broke!
That just clues you don't need to use it any more.
?Help! All the machines broke!
They leave behind something more useful later.
Near the end, you'll need target practice.
Once you get the Yard Ray...
USE YARD RAY ON TEST SET.
>>EMO DOME
?Why am I running past too fast?
Because you just want to get away.
You hear "hold up!" "back up!"
You need to FEEL more up, to DO something more up.
PULL UP.
If your cap is "pacy" and not "pact" then you won't be able to slow up in time.
Also, once you PULL UP, the Emo Dome is safe.
?Why can't I go north?
This is a near end of game thing.
You'll need a way to get in.
The eye level eye looks for identification on your skin.
Art Xtra has those soot tattoos.
You need to combine them with the gate tag that falls when you open the Etage GAte.
USE GATE TAG ON SOOT TATTOOS.
This can be done right away after you have both items.
>>SWEPT PEWS
?How do I deal with the wordy drow and liar grail?
The wordy drow is attached to the liar grail, but maybe you can free it.
The liar grail seems to throw things at you from all angles. Maybe if you could focus it.
USE PUCE CUP ON PAST SAP.
Then it turns into purist sirup.
USE PUCE CUP ON LIAR GRAIL.
?Why is the wordy drow's first moan starred out?
It's saying something palindromic, but some religions found it unspeakable.
Google the Tetragrammaton to determine the middle of the seven letters.
>>DRAWL WARD
?Can I help the Bond Nob?
Yes. She needs some sort of medicine.
The Demo Med doesn't work.
However, something more potent will.
You could use the Dose Sod from the Apse Spa...
...but you can't carry it on its own.
Use the Puce Cup to get it.
USE PUCE CUP ON BOND NOB.
>>DOPY POD
?What do I do with the demo med?
Just take it, for now.
?How do I clean up the cassettes sac? Is it worth it?
You need something powerful.
The Dirt Rid isn't powerful enough.
So you need to give it a boost.
You can use the Dirt Rid on the reviver back in Work Row.
USE CAVE VAC ON CASSETTES SAC.
>>SCRAP ARCS
?What to do with the slate metals?
They could get a pattern carved in them.
Anything that could carve a pattern?
The stamp mats in Frush Surf.
USE STAMP MATS ON SLATE METALS.
The key would be useful to open something locked.
>>TOLL LOT
?How do I get rid of the cross orc?
It wants money.
Someone else will give you money for helping them.
The Gulf Lug in Flu Gulf.
Help the Gulf Lug first to get the cash sac.
USE CASH SAC ON CROSS ORC.
?Is the crag arc hiding anything?
Yes, but you can't find it until you've gotten rid of the cross orc.
Once you do, you need an item that will detect things from a distance.
That item is the radar.
USE RADAR ON CRAG ARC.
>>GROSS ORG
?How do I get rid of Ned?
You need to do something to him.
The logic is ***(+) NED.
DENY NED.
?How do I get past the gate?
It's not too bad.
Did you make Ye Key in Scrap Arcs?
USE YE KEY ON ETAGE GATE.
>>PRO CORP
?Help! The Psi Wisp is vicious!
It chases you wherever you go.
Maybe you can find some place to defeat it.
It's sort of hidden.
Remember when Word/Work Row was something else?
There was a redness ender there.
The Psi Wisp is very red.
Backtrack to Word/Work Row.
WORN ROW.
?What to do here?
All sorts of cool stuff! Take everything you want!
?What do I do with the DNA band?
It's not quite something living.
It can become a body, or part of one.
If you use it on the reifier in Work Row, it becomes a more viable life form. Or part of one.
?What can I do with the butene tub?
More like, what can you do TO it.
An unstable chemical reaction.
Do you have anything particularly volatile in inventory?
USE GORGE GROG ON BUTENE TUB.
>>DEFT FED
?What does Sniffins want?
He is obviously upset.
He needs a confidence boost.
Maybe a book will help.
USE YOB ATTABOY ON SNIFFINS.
?What does Sniffins want now?
He finds the Gorge Grog tacky.
You need to find Class Alc.
Have you found the Elan Ale?
USE ELAN ALE ON SNIFFINS.
>>RED ROSES ORDER
?How do I defeat Madam?
You can't get in if you don't have what you need.
Something that's the opposite of her.
But you can't use the orb on her. It wouldn't magnify enough.
USE BRO ORB ON MIRROR RIM.
?What are the sword rows for for?
Well, there's one thing that needs to be carved.
USE BALSA SLAB ON SWORD ROWS.

;
>>BUSY SUB
?What can I do about the glam-amalg?
Note that using anything on it gives a decisive reject.
This is another verb you need to guess.
Everyone says oh. So, ohs.
And you need to do so too. But not say.
Listen more carefully, and you'll recognize a few SHAM AHS.
You'll definitely want to SHUN UHS. Or Shut them. But you want something more active.
Of course, you can't SHED EHS meaningfully, either.
SHOW OHS.
?What do I do with Flat Alf?
It's hard to get his attention, since he is 2-D and all.
FLAG ALF.
?What does Wolf Low want?
Nothing.
Because Wolf Low does not exist.
Neither does the Busy Sub.
Or Flat Alf.
You shouldn't develop clues you don't know the answers to yet!
Go, dog!
