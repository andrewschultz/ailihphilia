rand-cycle is a truth state that varies.

every turn (this is the notify cycling rule):
	if rand-cycle is true:
		let tn be a table-name;
		let tables-found be 0;
		now rand-cycle is false;
		repeat through table of all randoms:
			if thru-yet entry is 1:
				now thru-yet entry is 2;
				increment tables-found;
				if debug-state is true, say "DEBUG: will be cycling [tabnam entry].";
				if tables-found is 1:
					say "[line break][if there is a cycle-note entry][cycle-note entry][line break][else]Whoah...that sounds familiar. You suspect the dialogue will loop again.[end if]";
				else if tables-found is 2:
					say "This is a further note to say you've looped through random text more than once this turn, which is an impressive bit of timing, even if it doesn't get you any points.";
		if tables-found is 0 and debug-state is true, say "This is a BUG--you should have been notified of random cycling in a table, but you weren't.";
		the rule succeeds;
