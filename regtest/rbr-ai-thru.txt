As you're about to touch the lie veil, you shake your head. No. You don't really want or need to explore north. Surely there's some better place to be? Perhaps you're not 100% prepared for the lie veil's thought provoking paradoxes, and it's doing you a favor pushing you back? Plus what if it hides a hidden booby trap? You try to walk further north, but somehow you wind up walking back south.
