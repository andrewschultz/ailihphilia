>uu bro orb on madam
As you lift the Bro Orb to throw at Madam, you see yourself in the Mirror Rim. You don't look so great or heroic. In fact, you feel unusually self-conscious. More than you deserve to, you think. Besides, the Bro Orb might dissolve her or something, but you're not out to kill anyone.

>uu cave vac on gnu dung
The Cave Vac sputters. You may need something more specifically suited to the, uh, material to clean up.

>uu dna hand on yuge guy
The hand doesn't seem to want to move toward the Yuge Guy.

>uu dirt rid on cassettes sac
The Dirt Rid wheezes but is unable to clean up the cassettes sac. You need something more powerful.

>uu dirt rid on gnu dung
The Dirt Rid is ineffective. You may need something stronger.

>uu dirt rid on go-by bog
The bog is too big for that.

>uu epoch cope on revolt lover
"Wish I could be interested in politics, but I'm not."

>uu gorge grog on yuge guy
The Yuge Guy doesn't drink, and neither does Johnny. Also, the Yuge Guy may or may not be a germaphobe.

>uu gorge grog on cassettes sac
That'd clean up the cassettes sac, but it'd probably dissolve it, too.

>uu gorge grog on yard ray
The Gorge Grog is pretty strong stuff, but you may need something even stronger.

>uu me gem on me totem
The egotistical forces in the gem and totem repel each other. Just as well. You don't know if you could survive if such insufferability synergized.

>uu me gem on yuge guy
That might make the Yuge Guy's ego too much to handle.

>uu mr arm on yuge guy
Mr. Arm doesn't seem to want to move toward the Yuge Guy.

>uu null illun on revolt lover
"I guess we all could use it a little. But someone else might need it more than me. Um, I hope."

>uu party trap on revolt lover
"Whoah! Neat! That's a lot more useful than my art."

>uu rep popper on yuge guy
It seems like the Rep Popper should work, but it doesn't, quite. Maybe there is something that is giving the Yuge Guy all his rep?

>uu ti on revolt lover
"Hmm. A bit too mean for me. Maybe it's more someone else's speed."

>uu trap art on revolt lover
But the Revolt Lover gave it to you in the first place.

>uu ye key on diff id
You wave Ye Key in front of the Diff ID. Nothing happens. The engraving on Ye Key seems to match up with what the Diff ID wants to see, but maybe you need something else.

>uu bunk nub on sleep eels
That -- well, it almost works. But the bunk nub isn't shaped right to house that many small animals. Maybe it could be changed.

>uu cave vac on go-by bog
The bog is too big for that.

>uu demo med on elan ale
No, combining alcohol and pills is a bad, bad idea.

>uu demo med on gorge grog
No, combining alcohol and pills is a bad, bad idea.

>uu dork rod on kayak
The dork rod is too weak and wimpy to be an effective paddle.

>uu el doodle on known wonk
The Known Wonk looks at El Doodle, thinks, and says "Ugh, sorry, never could decipher these things. No good rules to. Maybe you could use the edits tide, though."

>uu el doodle on revolt lover
But the Revolt Lover pretty much offered it to you in the first place.

>uu el doodle on code doc
"This isn't quite clear enough for me. If you could clean it up, though, I could help you."

>uu elope pole on tao boat
The Tao Boat is too big to control with the elope pole.

>uu elope pole on crag arc
The pole is for navigation, not for vaulting.

>uu elope pole on go-by bog
The bog is too wide for that.

>uu elope pole on lie veil
The veil resists the pole. You need a more violent implement.

>uu elope pole on made dam
The pole is for navigation, not for vaulting.

>uu enact cane on kayak
The enact cane doesn't seem like the right tool to propel the kayak. It's more for chores.

>uu enact cane on rep popper
But that might bust your own rep, since you are the nearest person.

>uu exam axe on balsa slab
You're not sure what to cut the slab into, and you don't need firewood.

>uu exam axe on porch crop
That might be overkill. The wash saw, on the other hand...

>uu gate tag on diff id
You wave the gate tag in front of the DIFF ID, which beeps for a second, then ... nothing. Maybe the gate tag (or its pattern) needs to be read a different way.

>uu gold log on kayak
The gold log is too heavy to be an effective paddle.

>uu pity tip on door frood
The Door Frood is too good for a mere pity tip. Well, in the Door Frood's mind.

>uu poo coop on liar grail
Maybe if the contents came from a bull and not a gnu, it would be appropriate (this is not a palindrome "joke.")

>uu poo coop on yuge guy
That could be fun, but he might be too normalised to the stuff in the coop to do damage.

>uu radar on go-by bog
The radar detects nothing. So there is probably no horribly bogy gob. But there are plenty of other places you could slip and fall and disappear forever.
>purloin sage gas
>uu radar on go-by bog
The radar detects nothing. So there is probably no horribly bogy gob. But you got the sage gas, already.
>undo
>undo

>uu radar on sleep eels
A radar isn't supposed to work this way, but somehow, you detect some bitterness at mammals in general. But it's secondary to needing a more comfortable place to sleep.

>uu resale laser on made dam
There might be something behind the dam. But you need to be subtler looking for it.

>uu roto motor on kayak
The kayak is not electrical, and besides, the roto motor is too small.

>uu roto motor on tao boat
The tao boat is not electrical, and besides, the roto motor is too small.

>uu sage gas on sharp rahs
Hmm! The contrast between the two...that should work. But maybe you need some sort of intermediary that could hold them both.

>uu sharp rahs on bro orb
You feel a shock--perhaps you approached the Bro Orb too eagerly! But it seems you were on the right track.

>uu soot tattoos on diff id
The Diff-ID doesn't respond. Maybe you need a way to put them on you, somehow.

>uu stamp mats on tru yurt
The stamp mats aren't a home-y sort of mat.

>uu stamp mats on soot tattoos
Hmm. If the soot tattoos had a pattern, that would be interesting. But they don't, yet.

>uu stamp mats on yahoo hay
The mats don't quite work on the hay. They might work better on something with more surface area.

>uu state tats on diff id
You can just walk north to get through.

>uu taboo bat on me totem
Violence isn't the answer. The ME Totem is not repelled by moral turpitude.

>uu taboo bat on yuge guy
Violence isn't the answer. The Yuge Guy is not repelled by moral turpitude.

>uu taboo bat on bomb mob
No way. You'd be outnumbered. You'd need stealth.

>uu taboo bat on test set
This isn't cricket. You do, however, need to use SOME weapon on the test set.

>uu trap art on stark rats
Whatever's planned on the trap art might work, but not the trap art itself.

>uu troll ort on cross orc
The cross orc mutters something unrepeatable about prejudiced people who can't tell the DIFFERENCE between them and trolls and don't WANT to. But the way it looks at you, you suspect it'd forgive you if you gave the right gift.

>uu troll ort on ergot ogre
The ergot ogre mutters something unrepeatable about prejudiced people who can't tell the DIFFERENCE between them and trolls and don't WANT to. Perhaps you need a more violent way to dispose of the ogre.

>uu troll ort on kayo yak
As you hold the troll ort out, the Kayo Yak butts your hand! The troll ort goes flying. You walk over to pick it up. The yak seems weirdly attracted to it.

>uu wash saw on cassettes sac
The wash saw isn't big enough to clean up the cassettes sac. You need a more powerful cleaner.

>uu wash saw on crag arc
The crag arc is much too big to get anywhere. Maybe there's a better way to find what's behind there.

>purloin ufo tofu
>uu wash saw on crag arc
The crag arc is much too big to get anywhere.
!Maybe there's
>undo
>undo

>uu wash saw on lie veil
Not even the wash saw could clean off the lie veil. You need something much more brutal.

>uu wash saw on made dam
The made dam is much too big to get anywhere. Maybe there's a better way to find what's behind there.

>purloin eroded ore
>uu wash saw on made dam
The made dam is much too big to get anywhere.
!Maybe there's
>undo
>undo

>uu wash saw on stark rats
You couldn't catch and hold a rat long enough to cut it with the wash saw.

>uu yard ray on diktat kid
The Diktat Kid laughs as you point the yard ray. "Destroy me, but my work will remain!"

>uu yard ray on tru hurt
The Tru Hurt is dangerous, but maybe you should use the yard ray on something even more harmful.

>uu yard ray on waster fretsaw
The Waster Fretsaw is dangerous, but maybe you should use the yard ray on something even more harmful.
