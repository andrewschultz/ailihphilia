You know the Moo Room is a dead end, and since you got the poo coop from here, it seems like you need the yak to chase you somewhere else.

doesn't seem like the place to be. The Yak couldn't do much there.

The slog uphill is too much for you, but the kayo yak traverses it easily and bumps you before you can make it up all the way.
!With the turf rut filled in,

It's just too weird ahead to the north. You freeze up and are unable to avoid the kayo yak further.

Hmm, you didn't seem to need to go that way. Calcific Lac was a dead end.

!There was nothing in Calcific Lac OR Yack Cay you saw that could slow the yak down more than you. Well, that's another place you can ignore next time.
