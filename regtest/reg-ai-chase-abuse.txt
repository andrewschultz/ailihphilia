# start the fun. Verify that basic hints for good tries are working.
>use troll ort on kayo yak
As you hold the troll ort out, the Kayo Yak butts your hand! The troll ort goes flying. You walk over to pick it up. The yak seems weirdly attracted to it. Like it's the animal form of hate click bait. But it might be too much for the yak to hack all in one crack. Jack.
>gonear ergot ogre
>use troll ort on ergot ogre
The ergot ogre mutters something unrepeatable about prejudiced people who can't tell the DIFFERENCE between them and trolls and don't WANT to. Perhaps you need a less coercive way to dispose of the ogre.

#stuff that should fail quickly
>deep speed
Oops, that's too much for me to do at once! Either escape or get caught by the Kayo Yak first, then we can proceed
>gt seer trees
Wow! You outran the yak comfortably. The pace/pact cap seems to have helped, and even better, you don't feel particularly exhausted.

>gt yawn way
You run into some x-it stix that block your way to Fun Enuf.
Ooze Zoo
Well, all your items you dropped are still here, so that's something. You take them back, staying where the Kayo Yak won't quite find you.


#now for the real stuff

>get all
You've been caught!
You know the Moo Room is a dead end, and since you got the poo coop from here, it seems like you need the yak to chase you somewhere else.

doesn't seem like the place to be. The Yak couldn't do much there.

No, you've already been there, and though there are rooms beyond you didn't explore, maybe you should stick with places you know for now.

Brr. It was cold there. There was nothing north or east, and besides, you'd freeze before the yak did. Maybe you need it to chase you somewhere else.
Stung!

The slog uphill is too much for you, but the kayo yak traverses it easily and bumps you before you can make it up all the way.

It's just too weird and chaotic ahead to the north. Even with the yak chasing you, you freeze up.

Stung!

No, you've already been there
!There was nothing in Lac Oft Focal OR Roomy Moor you saw that could slow the yak down more than you. Well, that's another place you can ignore next time.

You don't remember much of the wisp getting you, but you remember Sniffins yelling and generally carrying on uselessly. If there's any place that can get rid of the Psi Wisp, it's not Deft Fed.

#now try to disrupt sniffins again

No, you've already been there, but it was a dead end with nothing to do.

Well, unsurprisingly, there was nothing clever in Dopy Pod. So you don't want to go back if you're chased again.

Scrap Arcs may've had materials, but there was nothing you could use.

Yyyuuuppp. Nothing to do here. You searched both west and east. Time to find somewhere else.

Hmm, you didn't seem to need to go that way. Trapeze Part was a dead end.

There are dangerous types in Yell Alley, but you doubt they could mutually take out the Psi Wisp.
#!evaded ave

Nothing to do west or east, and nothing here. The Psi Wisp might be a shock for the Door Frood ... but no way you'd outrace it through the tube. Somewhere else, then.
#!art xtra

There's nothing behind Art Xtra. The Revolt Lover would like to help you but can't. This can't be the way.

Alas, you can't evade the Psi Wisp here as you evaded Dave.

You're a wide-open target for the Psi Wisp here.

The wisp seemed to pause a bit before attacking.

You didn't immediately see anything useful around, but maybe there's something hidden that you forgot.

There are configurations to Work Row. One must help. Maybe next time, you'll sink the Psi Wisp.
#stuff that should fail

Oops, that's too much for me to do at once! Either escape or get caught by Psi Wisp first, then we can proceed.
>gt seer trees
You run into some x-it stix that block your way to Fun Enuf.
The Psi Wisp pulses close behind.
>gt yawn way
Already there! Er, here.
Stung!
