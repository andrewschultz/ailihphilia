"Keen! Eek!" the Flee Elf stops you. "You need to figure out the right way to take the Cap, for a place like Grebeberg or Yelpley."
>s
The Flee Elf encourages you to give taking the cap a shot--well, not quite TAKING it, but if you do take it, you'll be ready to go.
>s
"Oy! Oy! Yo-yo!" The Flee Elf encourages you to find the right way to take--er, get--er, pick up the cap.
>s
The Flee Elf mentions there are really only 26 simple ways to pick up the cap, if you think about it, and why not just brute force? You're not busy with anything else.
!When you get home, you open the X/O box.

OUT or any synonym is never necessary in the game, though if there is only one exit direction, you'll go that way.

Dave worked hard to build these muscles. It'd be mean if you could wipe them out. And impractical--they might be slowing him down a bit, and that could help you.

Not through the gnu dung you aren't.

As you're about to touch the lie veil, you shake your head. No. You don't really want or need to explore north. Surely there's some better place to be? Perhaps you're not 100% prepared for the lie veil's thought provoking paradoxes, and it's doing you a favor pushing you back? Plus what if it hides a hidden booby trap? You try to walk further north, but somehow you wind up walking back south.
