"Oy! Oy! Yo-yo!" The Flee Elf encourages you to find the right way to take--er, get--er, pick up the cap.

The Flee Elf mentions there are really only 26 simple ways to pick up the cap, if you think about it, and why not just brute force? You're not busy with anything else.

Not through the gnu dung you aren't.

As you're about to touch the lie veil, you shake your head. No. You don't really want or need to explore north. Surely there's some better place to be? Perhaps you're not 100% prepared for the lie veil's "thought-provoking" paradoxes, and it's doing you a favor pushing you back? Plus what if it hides a hidden booby trap? You try to walk further north, but somehow you wind up walking back south.

Once you're away from the Lie Veil, you forget its weird arguments. There's got to be a way, or weapon, to cut brutally through its sophistry.
