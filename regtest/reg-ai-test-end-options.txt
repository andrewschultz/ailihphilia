When you get home, you hear a click from the X/O box. Yes, you can open it now.
As you open it, you see a nice, spiffy tenet. An antimetabole (look it up) that somehow magically changes every day. It's nice, but it still feels a bit like getting socks for your birthday. Well, you had a feeling you left a few things undone.
Roxor!

You have a vision of Grebeberg and Yelpley sliding back in a few years to where they were. Well, you'll still have your memories. But you can't shake the feeling you could've finished a bit differently and helped keep Yelpley and Grebeberg safe even longer.
