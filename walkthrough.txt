Hello, and welcome to the walkthrough for Put it Up, an IFComp 2018 game by Andrew Schultz.

I didn't intend this game to be overly difficult or to have any weird profound meanings, but I had good laughs putting the puzzles together, and I hope you have fun solving them, even if you see what is going on and how there aren't THAT many possibilities to solve them.

There should be no way to die or be locked out of a win in Put it Up.

If you are technically inclined, you can grep -i "^>" walkthrough.txt to plow through. But if you're technically inclined, you likely won't need the walkthrough. Still, if you want the quick way without comments, there it is.

Some particular spoilers, such as the general procedure for puzzles, may be encoded in ROT13. You'll know them, because they look like gibberish. Copy and paste them to Rot13.com to see what happens.

Many point scoring commands will be palindromes. The others are of the form USE X ON Y. You can shorten them by just using one word. In other words,

So! Fun 'Nuf is, well, not fun enough to start. And worse yet, you can't leave until you know what to do with the Pact Cap! Well, you can leave through the Tix Exit, but that's no fun.

Takeing it doesn't work. TAKE says maybe if it were a KAT. GET says "Get, e.g. ..."

You need some sort of palindrome ending in CAP, and the simplest is PAC? CAP.

> PACK CAP

lets you take it.

Note if you examine it, you may be unhappy with it. You feel like it can do more. Later, you may need to go faster. You can get another point by calling it a PACE CAP or PACY CAP.

You also get a set-o-notes to replace the darer ad. They're still a bit vague, so we'll see wheat we can do with them, later.

That's all the points you can get for the Dim Mid region, for now. In fact, Fun Nuf is the only room in the Dim Mid...until the end.

Now you're kind of blocked at the Seer Trees in Grebeberg to the west, so maybe we can figure out how to get past the Start Rats.

Marge Pegram says the trap art is a useless design that didn't quite work. Maybe it'll work for you.

>GET TRAP ART

You need to do something with the trap art, somewhere.

>S

>EVADE DAVE

>W

>NAIL IAN

Now Worn Row isn't suitable for getting anything done, yet. How would you restore it as a place to BE and DO?

>WORK ROW

Now, the trap art goes with one of the machines, but which one?

>USE TRAP ART ON REIFIER

>E
>N

>W

How to get rid of the rats?

>USE PARTY TRAP ON START RATS

>N

>GET SPUR UPS

>S
>E

Now, you can go east.

>E
>PULL UP

You now have access to a few more rooms.

==========================================below is the Yuge Guy quest

>USE DORK ROD ON TAO BOAT

Now that you've been in the Tao Boat, you feel confident enough to pick up the Rep Popper.

>S.S.E.E.E.E.N.N.GET POPPER

And now you can take out the Yuge Guy.

>W.S.S.W.W.N.N.W.USE POPPER ON GUY

==========================================below is the Madam Sniffins quest

Okay, let's go deal with Madam Sniffins.

>GIVE ?? BOOK TO (PERSON IN ART XTRA)

>S.W.W.W.W.N

>USE EL DOODLE ON EDITS TIDE

>S

>S

>USE SPA MAPS ON CODE DOC

>N.E.E.E.S.W

>USE STINK KNITS ON ROTATOR

Yay! Brag garb!

The Kayo Yak seems to be kind of violent but won't attack you. Still, it comes up to sniff you. Maybe it could help you?

?? puzzle below not implemented yet

>USE TROLL ORT ON BRAG GARB

>N.N.W.W.S.S

Bye bye, Ergot Ogre!

>E

>USE SAGE GAS ON TENET

>N.N.E.N

>GET BRO ORB

>S.E.E.E.E.N

>USE BRO ORB ON MADAM SNIFFINS

==========================================below is stuff that's near the end

Now that you have all the ingredients for the North-Tron, you need to activate them. You don't have to use a lot of commands to build it. Any ingredient on another will work. Thus,

>USE MUSH SUM ON X/O BOX

But you still can't go north! You don't have a weapon!

>USE MURK RUM ON YARD RAY

Now you can go to the Dirge Grid.

>N

Now, using the yard ray on the Diktat Kid doesn't work. It has "Emit ********" on the side, and that suggests

>EMIT NOONTIME

>S

>USE X-ITE TIX ON TIX EXIT
==========================================below is stuff that's not in order

Now the Gold Log is shiny, but it's not particularly useful, and it's not you. It seems to be rattling, as if it holds something inside, but you can't figure out how to open it.

>PUT GOLD LOG IN ROTATOR

How do you feel peaceful enough to not be disrupted by your enemies?
