Hello, and welcome to the walkthrough for Put it Up, an IFComp 2018 game by Andrew Schultz.

I didn't intend this game to be overly difficult or to have any weird profound meanings, but I had good laughs putting the puzzles together, and I hope you have fun solving them, even if you see what is going on and how there aren't THAT many possibilities to solve them.

There should be no way to die or be locked out of a win in Put it Up.

If you are technically inclined, you can grep -i "^>" walkthrough.txt | sed "s/.*>//" to plow through. But if you're technically inclined, you likely won't need the walkthrough. Still, if you want the quick way without comments, there it is.

Some particular spoilers, such as the general procedure for puzzles, may be encoded in ROT13. You'll know them, because they look like gibberish. Copy and paste them to Rot13.com to see what happens.

Many point scoring commands will be palindromes. Most of the others are of the form USE X ON Y. You can shorten them by just using one word. In other words, to plagiarize from Kingdom of Loathing's Palindome, USE EVIL OLIVE ON TACO CAT can be shortened to USE OLIVE ON CAT. (I wrote a script to make sure the walkthrough and source were relatively synced, and I used full item names.)

So! Fun 'Nuf is, well, not fun enough to start. And worse yet, you can't leave until you know what to do with the Pact Cap! Well, you can leave through the Tix Exit, but that's no fun, unless you like seeing bad ends.

Flat out TAKEing the Pact Cap doesn't work. TAKE says maybe if it were a KAT. GET says "Get, e.g. ..."

You need some sort of palindrome ending in CAP, and the simplest is PAC? CAP.

(+1) > PACK CAP

lets you take it.

Note if you examine it, you may be unhappy with it. You feel like it can do more. You'll need it to, later. Maybe you can guess, but that's not necessary now. There are not too many immediate possibilities, and two work.

You also get a set-o-notes to replace the darer ad. They're still a bit vague, so we'll see wheat we can do with them, later.

That's all the points you can get for the Dim Mid region, for now. In fact, Fun Nuf is the only room in the Dim Mid...until the end.

Now you're kind of blocked at the Seer Trees in Grebeberg to the west, so maybe we can figure out how to get past the STARK RATS. We can explore a bit, too, first.

>E.N

Mike Kim says the trap art is a useless design that didn't quite work. Maybe it'll work for you.

>GET TRAP ART

Now let's open up the part of Yelpley that lets you fiddle with the items you've got.

>S.S

(+1) >EVADE DAVE

(+1) >BORE ROB

Now Worn Row isn't suitable for getting anything done, yet. It has that redness ender, but that looks kind of dangerous. How would you restore it as a place to BE and DO something constructive?

(+1) >WORD ROW

>GET TO IDIOT

>E.N.N.N

(+1) >USE TO IDIOT ON REVOLT LOVER

>GET DEBT BED

>E

>GET ALL

Note you can't get EVERYTHING. But the pity tip also gives a small clue...

(+1) >USE PITY TIP ON NAVY VAN

We'll deal with the snack cans (much) later.

>W.W

What to do with the ten-level net? It looks a bit shaky.

(+1) >TEND NET

>E.S.S.S.W

We can do something else with Worn Row!

(+1) >WORK ROW

Now, the trap art goes with one of the machines, but which one?

(+1) >USE TRAP ART ON REIFIER

(+1) >USE DEBT BED ON REVIVER

Now let's get another book.

>WORD ROW

>GET ERA FARE

You can only pick up one book at a time, and I think this is the best to start with to open up more of the map.

>E.N.W.W

(+1) >USE PARTY TRAP ON STARK RATS

>N

(+1) >USE ERA FARE ON KING NIK

Spur-ups! Ooh! We'll get to those in a bit.

>S.S

How to get past the eels? They are sleeping but look a bit uncomfortable.

(+1) >USE STOCK COTS ON SLEEP EELS

>S

The kayo yak is/was harmless, but it'll help you later. Where you'll have to make it a bit harmful.

>GET STAMP MATS.E.GET POO COOP

>W.N.N.E.E.S.W.GET YOB ATTABOY

>E.N

Now the Emo Dome pushes us back because it makes us feel ... down.

(+1) >PUFF UP

>E

There you go! But you still run through the Emo Dome too fast. How to stop yourself?

(+1) >PULL UP

You now have access to a few more rooms. But let's go cover a few we've seen, sort of, first.

>GET PUCE CUP

>W.W.W.N

(+1) >USE SWORD ROWS ON PAST SAP
>USE PUCE CUP ON PAST SAP

>N.W.W.W.N.E

(+1) > USE PUCE CUP ON DOSE SOD

>W.S.E.E.E.S.S

(+1) > USE PUCE CUP ON MARGE PEGRAM

Let's loot what's behind Marge, now.

>W.GET ALL.E.E

(+1) > USE STAMP MATS ON SLATE METALS

Ooh, a key! Not just any key, but YE KEY!

And maybe we can help the Gulf Lug now.

>W.N.N.W.W.W.N.N

(+1) > USE DEMO MED ON GULF LUG

A reward! We don't have much to buy, so...

>S.S.E.E.E.E

(+1) > USE CASH SAC ON CROSS ORC

>S

We can do a bit of the work in Deli, Tiled. Even change it.

(+1) > USE YOB ATTABOY ON SNIFFINS

(+1) > USE ELAN ALE ON SNIFFINS

(+1) > STAND NAT'S

>N.W.W.S.W

Now begins a chase! How to get rid of the Psi Wisp? It's reddish--do you remember anything else sort of red?

>S.S.W.W.S.W

(+1) >WORN ROW

Bam! There goes the Psi Wisp. Back to work. We have some stuff to convert, now, before going back to Pro Corp.

>WORK ROW

(+1) > USE STINK KNITS ON ROTATOR

(+1) >USE GATE TAG ON SOOT TATTOOS

>S.S.W.WORD ROW.GET NULL ILLUN.WORK ROW

Now the Gold Log is shiny, but it's not particularly useful, and it's not you. It seems to be rattling, as if it holds something inside, but you can't figure out how to open it.

>E.N.W.W.W

We can stop here to make passage to not one, but two, new places.

(+1) > USE POO COOP ON GNU DUNG
(+1) > USE POO COOP ON TURF RUT

>W

(+1) >USE RADAR ON MADE DAM

>N

We can help the Known Wonk out doubly, now, and even help ourselves a bit.

(+1) >USE NULL ILLUN ON KNOWN WONK
(+1) >USE EL DOODLE ON EDITS TIDE

>N

And we can do a lot on the Calcific Lac.

(+1) >USE ELOPE POLE ON KAYAK

How do you feel peaceful enough to not be disrupted by your enemies?

(+1) >USE DORK ROD ON TAO BOAT

>S.S.S

And now we can do a bit of double duty with the Code Doc.

(+1) >USE TENT NET ON CODE DOC
(+1) >USE SPA MAPS ON CODE DOC

The spa maps probably belong with ... the Apse Spa.

>N.E.E.N.E

(+1) >USE SPA MAPS ON GO-BY BOG

Now to get by the Ergot Ogre to the south of the Code Doc. You won't have seen the ogre if you just blindly followed this walkthrough, but trust me, it's there!

>W.S.S.S.E

(+1) >USE ENACT CANE ON YAHOO HAY
(+1) >PACE CAP
(+1) >USE TROLL ORT ON BRAG GARB

Now, run for your life!

>W.N.N.W.W.S.S

How to get the yak to charge?

(+1) >YAK OKAY

>E

(+1) >USE SAGE GAS ON TAME MAT

(+1) >USE SHARP RAHS ON GURU RUG

>W.N.N.E.S

What do we do about Ian? Once we do something, we can mix foods.

(+1) >NAIL IAN
(+1) >USE SNACK CANS ON UFO TOFU
(+1) >USE GIFT FIG ON MAYO YAM

Now you have all the ingredients for the North-Tron, and you need to activate them. But it's a bit more efficient to do other things first.

>N.W.N

(+1) >USE MOOR BROOM ON TRU YURT

>S.E

(+1) >USE EXAM AXE ON LIE VEIL

>N.GET ALL.S.E.E.E.S.W

Now with all the junk we have, we can make non-junk.

(+1) >USE BRO ORB ON MADAM

(+1) >USE BALSA SLAB ON WASH SAW

>S.W.S.W

The not-a-baton could use a boost.

(+1) >USE NOT-A-BATON ON REIFIER

Boom go the machines! Now you have a weapon to take out the Diktat Kid! But it's not loaded.

(+1) >USE MURK RUM ON YARD RAY

How do you turn it on?

(+1) >EMIT NOONTIME

Let's practise our aim.

(+1) >USE YARD RAY ON TEST SET

>E.N.W

(+1) >USE TNT ON ORE ZERO

>N

Now, carnage! And points! And so on.

(+1) >USE ME GEM ON KNIFE FINK
(+1) >USE TABOO BAT ON VERSES REV
(+1) >USE YARD RAY ON DIKTAT KID
>S

One last thing to do. It's not too tricky, I hope.
