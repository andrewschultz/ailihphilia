Hello, and welcome to the walkthrough for Put it Up, an IFComp 2018 game by Andrew Schultz.

I didn't intend this game to be overly difficult or to have any weird profound meanings, but I had good laughs putting the puzzles together, and I hope you have fun solving them, even if you see what is going on and how there aren't THAT many possibilities to solve them.

There should be no way to die or be locked out of a win in Put it Up.

If you are technically inclined, you can grep -i "^>" walkthrough.txt | sed "s/.*>//" to plow through. But if you're technically inclined, you likely won't need the walkthrough. Still, if you want the quick way without comments, there it is.

Some particular spoilers, such as the general procedure for puzzles, may be encoded in ROT13. You'll know them, because they look like gibberish. Copy and paste them to Rot13.com to see what happens.

Many point scoring commands will be palindromes. Most of the others are of the form USE X ON Y. You can shorten them by just using one word. In other words, to plagiarize from Kingdom of Loathing's Palindome, USE EVIL OLIVE ON TACO CAT can be shortened to USE OLIVE ON CAT. (I wrote a script to make sure the walkthrough and source were relatively synced, and I used full item names.)

So! Fun 'Nuf is, well, not fun enough to start. And worse yet, you can't leave until you know what to do with the Pact Cap! Well, you can leave through the Tix Exit, but that's no fun, unless you like seeing bad ends.

Flat out TAKEing the Pact Cap doesn't work. TAKE says maybe if it were a KAT. GET says "Get, e.g. ..."

You need some sort of palindrome ending in CAP, and the simplest is PAC? CAP.

(+1) > PACK CAP

lets you take it.

Note if you examine it, you may be unhappy with it. You feel like it can do more. You'll need it to, later. Maybe you can guess, but that's not necessary now. There are not too many immediate possibilities, and two work.

You also get a set-o-notes to replace the darer ad. They're still a bit vague, so we'll see wheat we can do with them, later.

That's all the points you can get for the Dim Mid region, for now. In fact, Fun Nuf is the only room in the Dim Mid...until the end.

Now you're kind of blocked at the Seer Trees in Grebeberg to the west, so maybe we can figure out how to get past the STARK RATS.

Marge Pegram says the trap art is a useless design that didn't quite work. Maybe it'll work for you.

>GET TRAP ART

You need to do something with the trap art, somewhere. But first, let's look behind Art Xtra.

>N.GET DEBT BED

Useful for later.

>W

(+1) >TEND NET

>E.S.S.S

Oh no! Dave's here, man! How to get around Dave?

(+1) >EVADE DAVE

>W

(+1) >BORE ROB

??TRACE CART

Now Worn Row isn't suitable for getting anything done, yet. It has that redness ender, but that looks kind of dangerous. How would you restore it as a place to BE and DO something constructive?

(+1) >WORK ROW

Now, the trap art goes with one of the machines, but which one?

(+1) >USE TRAP ART ON REIFIER

Also, the debt bed can be improved, too.

(+1) >USE DEBT BED ON REVIVER

You can also tinker with it in other ways. Let's see about that.

(+1) >WORD ROW

>GET ERA FARE

You can only pick up one book at a time, and I think this is the best to start with to open up more of the map.

>E.N.W.W

How to get rid of the rats?

(+1) >USE PARTY TRAP ON STARK RATS

>S

How to get past the eels? They are sleeping but look a bit uncomfortable.

(+1) >USE STOCK COTS ON SLEEP EELS

>S

The kayo yak is/was harmless, but it'll help you later.

>E.GET POO COOP.W.N.N.W

Now we need to make passage west and south. Fortunately one way is removing something, and the other requires filling something in. We'll worry about the lie veil later.

(+1) > USE POO COOP ON GNU DUNG
(+1) > USE POO COOP ON TURF RUT

>E.N

(+1) >USE ERA FARE ON KING NIK

The Spur Ups make you feel more with-it.

>S.E.E

You feel you could almost go east, but you need to do something "up."

(+1) >PUFF UP

>E

There you go! But you still run through the Emo Dome too fast. How to stop yourself?

(+1) >PULL UP

You now have access to a few more rooms.

==========================================below is the Yuge Guy quest

The Known Wonk won't let me pass. What to do?

(+1) > USE NULL ILLUN ON KNOWN WONK

>N

How to get to Elided Ile? Probably one of the kayak and Tao Boat. But the kayak has a means of propulsion in your inventory...

(+1) >USE ELOPE POLE ON KAYAK

The Tao Boat can transport you, too. Just spiritually and not physically.

(+1) >USE DORK ROD ON TAO BOAT

Now that you've been in the Tao Boat, you feel confident enough to pick up the Rep Popper. But let's take a detour to make the You Buoy into something more useful.

>S.S.E.E.E.E

>S.W

(+1) >USE YOU BUOY ON ROTATOR

>N.N.GET POPPER

And now you can take out the Yuge Guy.

>W.S.S.W.W.N.N

The scorn rocs are annoyingly in the way.

?? take Nat's first

(+1) > STAND NAT'S

(+1) > USE NAT'S TAN ON SCORN ROCS

>W

(+1) >USE REP POPPER ON YUGE GUY

==========================================below is the Madam Sniffins quest

Okay, let's go deal with Madam Sniffins.

>S.W.W.W.W.N

(+1) >USE EL DOODLE ON EDITS TIDE

>S

>S

(+1) >USE TENT NET ON CODE DOC

(+1) >USE SPA MAPS ON CODE DOC

>N.E.E.E.S.W

(+1) >USE STINK KNITS ON ROTATOR

Yay! Brag garb!

The Kayo Yak seems to be kind of violent but won't attack you. Still, it comes up to sniff you. Maybe it could help you?

(+1) >USE TROLL ORT ON BRAG GARB

>N.N.W.W.S.S

The yak still needs a command.

(+1) >YAK OKAY

Bye bye, Ergot Ogre!

>E

(+1) >USE SAGE GAS ON GURU RUG

>N.N.E

Now to get rid of the Lie Veil. You could've done this earlier, but this is in the flow. (Bad directions)

(+1) > USE DIRT RID ON REVIVER
(+1) > USE CAVE VAC ON TRU YURT

(+1) >USE EXAM AXE ON LIE VEIL

And you may want a way to get into the Red Roses Order.

(+1) >USE GATE TAG ON SOOT TATTOOS

>GET BRO ORB

>S.E.E.E.E.N

(+1) >USE BRO ORB ON MADAM

==========================================

==========================================below is stuff that's near the end

Finally, you can head to Mount Nom.

(+1) > NAIL IAN

(+1) > USE SNACK CANS ON UFO TOFU
(+1) > USE GIFT FIG ON MAYO YAM

Now that you have all the ingredients for the North-Tron, you need to activate them. You don't have to use a lot of commands to build it. Any ingredient on another will work. Thus,

(+1) >USE TNT ON ORE ZERO

But you still can't go north! You don't have a weapon!

(+1) >USE MURK RUM ON YARD RAY

Now you can go to the Dirge Grid. But ... it'd be nice to know what to do before you stumble in there. Maybe you have something harmless to shoot.

(+1) >EMIT NOONTIME

Now, what can you shoot that you won't miss, but it's sturdy enough you can make sure the Yard Ray works?

>E.S.W

(+1) >USE YARD RAY ON TEST SET

Okay! You're ready now!

>E.N.W.N

Uh oh. Two henchmen.

(+1) >USE ME GEM ON KNIFE FINK
(+1) >USE TABOO BAT ON VERSES REV
(+1) >USE YARD RAY ON DIKTAT KID

>S

(+1) >USE X-ITE TIX ON TIX EXIT

==========================================below is stuff that's not in order

Now the Gold Log is shiny, but it's not particularly useful, and it's not you. It seems to be rattling, as if it holds something inside, but you can't figure out how to open it.

(+1) >USE GOLD LOG ON ROTATOR

How do you feel peaceful enough to not be disrupted by your enemies?

(+1) >USE PUCE CUP ON DOSE SOD
(+1) >USE PUCE CUP ON MARGE PEGRAM

==========================================below is totally unsorted uncommented stuff, lumped together by the quests they're with
