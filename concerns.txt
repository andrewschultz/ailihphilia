Concerns so far:

* Not sure how to navigate changes from guess the verb
* still need to flesh out hints
* LLPs are lumped together (2 in 1 place) -- we expect this by the Birthday Paradox, but I'd like to clean it up. There must be an empty room.

* GT / going to a room can be different code oaths. after printing room description?
