Concerns so far:

* Not sure how to navigate changes from guess the verb to USE X ON Y
* still need to flesh out hints
* anything I can find that will give detail, I want to know about, as I've put in quite a lot of placeholders
* LLPs are lumped together (2 in 1 place) -- we expect this by the Birthday Paradox, but I'd like to clean it up. There must be an empty room besides the Moo Room. Felines/Bees though it's animals...

* GT / going to a room can be different code oaths. after printing room description?

* track good tries in score
* link to concerns file on quitting or winning
