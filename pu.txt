>Introduction
?What's this game about?
Palindromes.
It's a bit restrictive, since they're a bit rare.
But I hope you find my riffs on them interesting.
>Dim Mid
>>FUN 'NUF
?Why can't I leave?
You need to take the pact cap the right way, to show you're serious about things.
TAKE CAP doesn't work.
What's a theme of the game?
Palindromes.
?How do I take the cap?
The command ?????? CAP needs to be a palindrome.
How do you put a cap in inventory? Tuck it away?
PACK CAP.
?Why doesn't the cap seem perfectly satisfactory?
You can do one other thing with the cap, to make yourself go faster.
It must be some command like PAC? CAP.
PACE CAP.
Also, PACY CAP is accepted, too.
?Which way do I go first?
Well, one way, there's only one room you can explore.
Also, there are no permadeaths.
There's no penalty for guessing wrong.
You'll want to start by going east.
?Hey! Look! There's a way back south!
The Tix Exit appears pretty soon, but it doesn't let you through.
Unsurprisingly, you need tix of your own.
You don't get them until the end.
Once you defeat the Diktat Kid, you get X-ITE TIX. Wow!
Which claim to lead you to a bigger adventure.
Use the tix on the exit.
Or, well, you can just go south.
And you win the game!
?How do I build the North-Tron?
It'll take a long time.
Once you have all the ingredients, you'll know.
USE TNT ON MUSH SUM.
Well, it can be any ingredient on any ingredient.
?I built the North-Tron. Why can't I go north?
You need a weapon.
There is a Yard Ray located elsewhere.
Also, you'll need to load the Yard Ray.
With something suitably weird and energetic.
USE MURK RUM ON YARD RAY.
?Now I defeated the Diktat Kid, how do I get out?
This one should be pretty simple.
You got a new item in the Dirge Grid.
It's similar to the Tix Exit.
USE X-ITE TIX ON TIX EXIT.
You win!
>>DIRGE GRID
?How do I defeat the Diktat Kid?
You can't quite just use the yard ray. You need a special command.
The yard ray has EMIT ********.
The Dirge Grid is kind of dark.
You need one final palindrome command.
EMIT NOONTIME.
Now you will get a new item, and you can go back south and win the game.
>Grebeberg
>>SEER TREES
?How do I get rid of the Start Rats?
You need a Trap.
Well, you may guess a specific sort of trap.
A Party Trap.
You can make it in Work Row, in Yelpley.
You have to do something to another item. But once you get it...
USE PARTY TRAP ON START RATS.
>>COLD LOC
?Is there anything to do here?
You pretty much just need the Spur Ups from here.
>>APSE SPA
?Can I peel off the dose sod?
Yes, but you'll need a container.
The Puce Cup in Ned's Den works well.
USE PUCE CUP ON DOSE SOD.
?Is there anything beyond the Apse Spa, in Go-By Bog?
Yes, but it'd be tricky without a map or something.
You need to get the spa maps.
Not only do you need them, you need someone who can make sense out of them.
Once you get them, you will find something cool if you
USE SPA MAPS ON GO-BY BOG.
Or you can just examine the maps in Apse Spa.
>>FLU GULF
?How to I help out the Gulf Lug?
He needs something to cure him.
If you haven't figured the Emo Dome yet, you won't have seen it.
The Swept Pews have what you need.
The Demo Med.
USE DEMO MED ON GULF LUG.
?Why can't I go west?
You need a protection against the Yuge Guy's orange-ish radiation.
Did you get the Nat's Tan in Bon Snob?
It's icky to even handle, without using.
You need to feel mentally prepared to take it.
STAND NAT'S.
>>OOZE ZOO
?How do I get rid of the sleep eels?
They are blocking you but don't seem comfortable.
Maybe you can find a nicer place for them to sleep.
Or something nicer to sleep on.
The Debt Bed doesn't quite work.
But you can turn it into something nicer.
USE DEBT BED ON REVIVER.
USE STOCK COTS ON SLEEP EELS.
>>DRAY YARD
?What do I do with the yak?
It's a bit complicated.
USE TROLL ORT ON BRAG GARB.
Now the yak runs after you.
You need to run N.N.W.W.S.S. to the Ergot Ogre.
The yak knocks the ogre over, allowing you passage east from the Lair Trial.
>MOO ROOM
?What do I do here?
Get the Poo Coop.
>>TOP SPOT
?How do I kill off the Yuge Guy?
You'll need something to dent his pride.
Something you yourself may have had trouble taking, because you were too proud at first.

?How do I get rid of the gnu dung?
You need something that can hold dung, or something like it.
The poo coop.

You need something true, or something that shows you've been true.
If you get rid of all the books, you'll get a neat item.
USE EXAM AXE ON LIE VEIL.

?Can I make any sort of special food here?
Yes, from two other foods.
They'll combine too grossly elsewhere, but not here.
USE UFO TOFU ON MAYO YAM.

It looks pretty hashed together, bumpy. Something could be in there.
USE RADAR ON MADE DAM.

Do you have a document that almost, but doesn't quite, make sense?
The spa maps, once you get them.
USE SPA MAPS ON CODE DOC.
>>LAIR TRIAL
?What to do here?
Not much.
>>MOTTO BOTTOM
?What is the guru rug for?
It hides an even greater secret.
It seems like it could almost float.
But you don't feel like you can touch it.
What could help the guru rug float away?
The sage gas.
USE SAGE GAS ON GURU RUG.
>>YACK CAY
?How do I get past the Known Wonk?
The Known Wonk seems to know a lot, but that doesn't contribute to happiness.
Maybe a book could help.
USE NULL ILLUN ON KNOWN WONK.
What is the Edits Tide good for?
USE EL DOODLE ON EDITS TIDE.

But do something to him. ????? DAVE.
EVADE DAVE.
>WORN ROW
?How do I get past Ian?
NAIL IAN.
?It's empty here. How do I fill things out a bit?
They're worN. But maybe worn row can become...
WORK ROW.
You can also change it to something else.
WORD ROW.
?What do I put in which machine?
You can use trial and error.
Or you can just use the spoilers below.

Because you just want to get away.
You hear "hold up!" "back up!"
You need to FEEL more up, to DO something more up.
PULL UP.
If your cap is "pacy" and not "pact" then you won't be able to slow up in time.
Also, once you PULL UP, the Emo Dome is safe.
>>SWEPT PEWS
?How do I deal with the mat?
TAMP MAT.
>>DRAWL WARD
?Can I help Marge Pegram?
Yes. She needs some sort of medicine.
The Demo Med doesn't work.
However, something more potent will.

Fill in later.

Help the Gulf Lug first to get the cash sac.
USE CASH SAC ON CROSS ORC.
?Is the crag arc hiding anything?
Yes, but you can't find it until you've gotten rid of the cross orc.
Once you do, you need an item that will detect things from a distance.
