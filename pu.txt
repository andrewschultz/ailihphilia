>Introduction
?What's this game about?
Palindromes.
It's a bit restrictive, since they're a bit rare.
But I hope you find my riffs on them interesting.
>Dim Mid
>>FUN 'NUF
?Why can't I leave?
You need to take the pact cap the right way, to show you're serious about things.
TAKE CAP doesn't work.
What's a theme of the game?
Palindromes.
?How do I take the cap?
The command ?????? CAP needs to be a palindrome.
How do you put a cap in inventory? Tuck it away?
PACK CAP.
?Why doesn't the cap seem perfectly satisfactory?
You can do one other thing with the cap.
PAC? CAP.
PACE CAP or PACY CAP will help you go faster, later.
?Which way do I go first?
Well, one way, there's only one room you can explore.
Also, there are no permadeaths.
There's no penalty for guessing wrong.
You'll want to start by going east.
>>XYZ
?Whuddup?
The sky.
>Grebeberg
>>SEER TREES
?How do I get rid of the Start Rats?
You need a Trap.
Well, you may guess a specific sort of trap.
A Party Trap.
Once you get it, USE TRAP ON RATS.
>>YACK CAY
?How do I go west?
You'll need something to protect you from the Flu Gulf.
Some sort of antidote and something to put that antidote in.

>Not-Kook-Ton
>>YAWN WAY
?Is there anything to do here?

>>MY GYM
?Can I get the resto poster?
Yes, once Dave's not in the way.
?How do I get around Dave?
Well, you need to avoid him. Not quite avoid him.
????? DAVE.
EVADE DAVE.
>>EMO DOME
?Why am I running past too fast?
Because you just want to get away.
You hear "hold up!" "back up!"
You need to FEEL more up, to DO something more up.
PULL UP.
If your cap is "pacy" and not "pact" then you won't be able to slow up in time.
Also, once you PULL UP, the Emo Dome is safe.
>>BON SNOB
?How do I keep people happy here?
The resto poster from My Gym will work well.
