README for Ailihphilia

2018 IFComp candidate

It's about, well, palindromes.

To-do:

* Redo the beginning, talking more in-depth about the Diktat Kid, Yuge Guy and Madam.
* Fill in the end, with more silly stuff
* cut down notes.txt so that all anagrams that seem like good ideas are put into the game some way or other
* look at generated f-d and l-d files in the source directory for business names
* go through 3w-source-edit.txt before end of March. Goals: new random book names for the tract cart and possible new location name.

Utils explanations are in the Utils subdirectory.
