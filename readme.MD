README for Put It Up

Possible 2018 IFComp candidate

It's about, well, palindromes.

To-do:

* Sort through (f/d/l)/(f/d/l) files.
* Fix map.

Utils:

* 1w.py = 1 word and all the others that match it for palindromes. Can take space or comma separated values.
* 3w.py = 3 word combo checker. Takes a while. Can skip uneven first/last palindromes e.g. stab bat.
* 2pal.py = 2 word palindromes with optional first, last or middle string added, along with any combo of first/last name or word list
* dnm.py = searches the table file for names that are reused in the source. Not palindrome specific, as it is used for Spell Woken too.
